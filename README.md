# What is pquery?
pquery is an open-source (GPLv2 licensed) multi-threaded test program created to stress test the MySQL server (in any flavor), either randomly or sequentially, for QA purposes. Given it's modern C++ core, it is able to maximise the physical server's queries per second (qps) rate. pquery is an acronym for 'parallel query'. Prebuild pquery binaries (with statically linked client libraries) for Percona Server, MySQL Server, MariaDB, and WebScaleSQL are available as part of the pquery framework.

# What is the pquery framework?
When the pquery binary is used in combination with the Bash scripted pquery framework and a medium spec QA server (Intel i7/16GB/SSD), a QA engineer can achieve 80+ mysqld crashes per hour. The pquery framework further offers automatic testcase creation, bug filtering, sporadic issue handling, true multi-threaded testcase reduction, near-100% bug reproducibility and much more. The pquery framework furthermore contains high quality SQL input files, and "already known bug" filter lists for Percona Server and MySQL Server. The pquery framework is also GPLv2 licensed, and available from GitHub here: ...LINK...

# What is reducer.sh?
Reducer.sh is a high-end multi-threaded SQL testcase simplification tool. It is [...WILL BE SOON...] included in the pquery Framework, linked above.

# Any pquery success stories?
+ In the first ~2 months of it's life, over 200 bugs were logged with Oracle, Percona and TokuTek, most with high quality short testcases. 
+ Early MySQL Server 5.7 versions, including RC1 & RC2, were tested with pquery in preparation for Percona Server 5.7. Many bugs, especially in RC1, were found & logged. Chapeau to the MySQL server team who triaged all bugs & resolved major bugs as can be seen in the [5.7.7](http://mysqlserverteam.com/the-mysql-5-7-7-release-candidate-is-available/) and [5.7.8](http://mysqlserverteam.com/the-mysql-5-7-8-release-candidate-is-available/) MYSQL server team notes.

# How to build pquery?
1. Install cmake >= 2.6, gcc-c+, and GCC >= 4.7, the development files for your MySQL version/fork, and potentially OpenSSL and AIO development files and/or other deps if needed.
2. Change dir to pquery
3. Run cmake with the required options, which are:
  * *PERCONASERVER* - **OFF** by default, build pquery with Percona Server support 
  * *WEBSCALESQL* - **OFF** by default, build pquery with WebScaleSQL support
  * *MYSQL* - **OFF** by default, build pquery with Oracle MySQL support
  * *MARIADB* - **OFF** by default, build pquery with MariaDB support
  * *STATIC_LIB* - **ON** by default, compile pquery with MySQL | Percona Server | WebScaleSQL static client library instead of dynamic
  * *DEBUG* - **OFF** by default, compile pquery with debug inforamation for GDB
  * *STRICT* - **ON** by default, compile pquery with strict flags   
4. If you have MySQL | Percona Server | WebScaleSQL | MariaDB installed to some custom location you may consider setting the additional flags to cmake: *MYSQL_INCLUDE_DIR* and *MYSQL_LIBRARY*. OR, you can set *BASEDIR* variable if you have binary tarball extracted to some custom place for fully automatic library detection (recommended).
5. The resulting binary will automatically receive an appropriate flavor suffix:
  * *pquery-ms* for MySQL
  * *pquery-ps* for Percona Server
  * *pquery-ws* for WebScaleSQL
  * *pquery-md* for MariaDB

Please note that only the MySQL client library will be linked statically if STATIC_LIB is set, all other required libraries will be linked dynamically.

# Can you give an easy build example using an extracted tarball?
```
$ cd pquery
$ cmake . -DPERCONASERVER=ON -DBASEDIR=/tmp/Percona-Server-5.6.26-rel73.2-Linux.x86_64
$ make && make install
$ git clean -xfd
$ ... building other MySQL flavors/forks here ...
```

--socket | Socket file to use | --socket=/tmp/socket.sock
--user | The MySQL userID to be used | --user=root
--password | The MySQL user's password | --password=pazsw0rd
--threads | The number of client threads to use | --threads=1
--queries_per_thread | The number of queries to randomly execute per thread | --queries_per_thread=100000
--verbose | Produce verbose output yes/no | --verbose
--log_all_queries | Log all queries yes/no | --log_all_queries
--log_failed_queries | Log failed queries yes/no | --log_failed_queries
--no-shuffle | Replay SQL shuffled (randomly) or not (sequentially) | --no-shuffle
